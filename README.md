# Pokemon test

Hello. This is the Immfly frontend code test. You have to build a web application listing the **first pokemon generation**.

## Features to implement
### Build and style the main list
You have to implement the main list like in this image:
<img align="center" src="https://imgur.com/HNu1wmq.png" style="border: 1px solid black" />

Notice that:
*  The url is **/pokemon**.
*  When user hovers a pokemon, its background becomes gray.


### Pokemon detail page
Add the possibility to click on a pokemon and go to the detail page, like in this image:
<img align="center" src="https://imgur.com/1Mbh6mK.png" style="border: 1px solid black" />

Notice that the pokemon detail url is different. It is ``/pokemon/:name``. In the **charizard** example is ``/pokemon/charizard``.


### Images
The images url is ``http://pokestadium.com/sprites/xy/{name}.gif``

For example:
* **Charizard** <img align="center" src="http://pokestadium.com/sprites/xy/charizard.gif"/>
* **Bulbasaur** <img align="center" src="http://pokestadium.com/sprites/xy/bulbasaur.gif" />

*You will realize that there are two pokemon which image is not loaded properly. Put in practice your skills to solve it.*

### Api Endpoints
The api base url is ``https://pokeapi.co/api/v2``.
* **List**: ``/pokemon`` (maybe you have to add the limit parameter on the request to fetch the first generation in only one request).
* **Detail**: ``/pokemon/:name``.

For example:
* **Charizard**: ``https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charizard`` 
* **Bulbasaur**: ``https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur`` 

## Demo
You can watch/download the video showing how the app finally should work: <a href="https://mega.nz/#!2JNVlIzb!kmmubCQEUQV0RgZ9dExTC64P_9eDNBPE8zgNNS-b0do" target="_blank">demo</a>.

## üßê We want to see üßê
- React knowledge
- Project architecture
- Css skills
- ECMAScript6 skills
- Clean code

## ‚úÖ You should ‚úÖ
- Use the **axios** package for http requests.
- **Prevent unknown urls** while redirecting to the list page.
- Style with **responsiveness**. As the video shows, the pokemon list should adapt to the screen size and show three pokemons per row on large width screen size, two pokemon per row on medium width screen size and one pokemon per row on mobile width sizes. (You have a file named mixins.scss, in which you can use the existing medias in order to configure the responsiveness).

## üö´ You should not üö´
- Use bootstrap.

## üåü Bonus üåü
- Use **redux**.
- Add **tests**.
- Use **prop types**.
- Show a **loading indicator** while an api request is in process.
- Follow a **linter**.
- **Dockerize**
- Dockerize **hotreload** mode

‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† **Once you finish the test, throw a Pull Request to the master branch on this repository.** ‚ö†‚ö†‚ö†
